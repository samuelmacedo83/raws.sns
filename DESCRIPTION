Description: This is an R wrapper from the AWS Command Line Interface that 
  provides methods to send messages using Amazon Simple Notification Service. 
  You can create as many topics as you want, subscribe users to a topic and
  send notifications to them via SMS or e-mail. It also provides a function to
  automatically install AWS CLI, but you can download it and install it 
  manually if you prefer.
